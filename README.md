# FizikKreyol

This repository is used to manage the code source of the website FizikKreyol.

As you may know, this website is a project to bring up to date pedagogic information
about physics and math in Haitian creole for the greater good of the young (and not so young) haitians.

If you want to contribute to that project, (even by pointing out our mistakes) your are welcomed !


In that case, please send us a message, we speak Haitian Creole, French and English (possibly others!).
This is currently a benevole project, for which we are spending our free time, aside of our daily work and activities,
so you may experience some delay between your message and our answers.

## How to contribute to the website 

- First, if you would have to create a GitHub account, if you do not have already one. The free version should suffice.
  
- You can clone the repository in your local machine.  [A GitHub resource about cloning repository](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository).
  
- You can edit all the files needed in your local machine, with you preferred editor.

- The files that you want to edit will probably resides in the 'docs' folder. We are currently using [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
  
- You **commit** these changes in a branch. If needed, see that [Git tutorial](https://git-scm.com/docs/gittutorial).
  
- After *testing* your changes, you can **push** your branch to the remote repository.
  
- And then you create a [**pull request**](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) against the **main** branch. Make sure to ask one the repository administrator to review your work.
  
- After review and approval, you or the administrator will [**squash**](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/administering-a-repository/about-merge-methods-on-github) your branch into the **main** branch.
  
- You have done an **amazing work** !!!

This is of course a public repository but we would greatly appreciate to have an informal exchange with you, before your pull request.

At any moment, depending of our resources, we could turn this one into a private repository.
